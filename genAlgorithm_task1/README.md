The task was to use a binary genetic algorithm for solving the McCormick function.
To solve this specific task, it was necessary to use a combination of B U T M [B - binary genetic algorithm, U - uniform crossover, T - point mutation bit flip, M - McCormick function].


To run the program, you need to enter in the console (cmd prompt): python gen.py,
alternatively, to run a special configuration: python gen.py config#.json.
