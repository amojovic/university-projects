This project is a desktop application for managing architectural design projects with buildings and rooms. It uses design patterns like Composite (for project hierarchy), Observer (for messaging), Factory (for creating nodes and loggers), State (for room editing modes), and Command (for undo/redo).

The UI features a JTree to navigate projects, buildings, and rooms, and a TabbedPane for editing rooms. Users can add, edit, and organize room elements with interactive tools.

It includes error messaging, logging (console and file), JSON-based saving/loading, and room templates for easy setup.
