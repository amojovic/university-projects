Problem 1: Decision Trees
I built and trained a decision tree model to classify Titanic passengers as survived or not, using the provided dataset. I also cleaned and preprocessed the data to improve accuracy.

Problem 2: Neural Network
I implemented a neural network from scratch (using only matrices, no high-level libraries like Keras) to classify whether Titanic passengers survived, again using the same dataset and necessary data preprocessing.

Problem 3: Behavioral Cloning
I used a car simulator to collect driving data by manually driving and recording images from a virtual car camera along with steering angles. Then, I implemented and trained a Keras model (filled in build_model and train_model in model.py) to predict the steering angle from camera images. I used ModelCheckpoint to save the model during training.

After training, I tested the model in autonomous mode in the simulator, where the car drives itself using the trained model. The focus was on driving the left track successfully.
