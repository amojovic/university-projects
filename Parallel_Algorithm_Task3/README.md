GPU Image Processing with CUDA, 
Implemented fast image processing functions using CUDA and PyCUDA, including:

Converting color images to grayscale using GPU shared memory for better performance.

Adjusting image brightness by changing pixel values based on the average brightness.

Applying Gaussian blur to images using a filter that smooths the image on all color channels.

Handled memory transfer between CPU and GPU, and designed code to work efficiently with different image sizes.
