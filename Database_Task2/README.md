The task was to design and implement a Java application that connects to a local SQL database using JDBC. Specifically, I had to create a database to store information about planets, satellites, missions, users, housing units, and travel bookings. Then, develop a graphical user interface with forms for user registration and login, selecting a habitable planet or satellite, choosing housing units, selecting travel dates, and reviewing purchase history. I wrote SQL queries to retrieve and update data, using prepared statements to ensure security and efficiency. This project required combining database design, backend development, and frontend UI implementation into a fully functional application.
